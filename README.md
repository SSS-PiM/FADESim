# FADESim
FADESim: Fast and Accurate Design Exploration for realistic Memristive Accelerators (MAs) considering non-idealities.
see https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2024.3485589 for details.

The term FADE in FADESIM has a dual meaning. It refers to non-idealities that decrease computational accuracy and reliability, causing MA
to fade (i.e., lose its functionality). Therefore, FADESIM denotes simulations that consider non-idealities.


The code will be released before December 2024.
